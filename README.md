HyRex is a Python+JAX package for differentiable computation hydrogen and helium recombination.  HyRex is a JAX implementation of HYREC-2 and matches HYREC-2 output at sub percent-level accuracy.  HyRex is meant to be used in conjunction with a differentiable Boltzmann solver for the CMB (see [ABCMB](https://github.com/TonyZhou729/ABCMB)), but can also be used as a standalone code.
